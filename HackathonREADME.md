# PonchoNotes
Where ideas stick and sustain.



Project Details
INSPIRATION
Most inspiration for PonchoNotes comes from efficiency tools like Obsidian and Notion. One thing we noticed when we were testing these platforms, was a lack of productivity-focused note-taking apps.

WHAT IT DOES
In simple terms, PonchoNotes is a note companion built for augmented reality systems that are able to interop with your smartphone and other devices without stealing your attention

HOW WE BUILT IT
A good majority of our work was maintaining parity in terms of the team's overall understanding which allowed us to flex into building different milestones of the minimum viable product. Iteration was a key aspect of what we would consider a success in a hackathon. Our tech stack included Unity, C#, and the XREAL SDK.

CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO
Since we built on top of the XREAL SDK, there are a lot of functionalities that we had to learn for the first time. In terms of software, we were facing issues with the Gradle version and learning the nuances of how Unity handles different behaviors of gameObjects.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE'RE PROUD OF
Going into the Hackathon, we had an idea about what we wanted to build based on prior knowledge but the flexibility to learn an entirely new platform under a time constraint is definitely an achievement for most of us.

WHAT WE LEARNED
The PonchoNotes project served as a transformative learning experience for the team. Most of us began this journey with limited to no familiarity with Unity and augmented reality tools. The learning curve encompassed everything from grasping the intricacies of raytracing to understanding the hardware nuances behind AR glasses. Our collective immersion into these realms expanded our skill set and deepened our understanding of the immersive technologies driving PonchoNotes.

WHAT'S NEXT FOR PONCHONOTES
Moving forward, our focus for PonchoNotes is on refining the project's user interface (UI) to enhance its realism and overall user experience. Our goal is to make the project look and feel more authentic, providing users with an immersive and visually appealing digital environment for note-taking. This effort goes beyond aesthetics; it's about creating a UI that seamlessly mirrors the physical world, elevating the application to be an intuitive extension of the user's cognitive space. By fine-tuning UI elements, we aim to optimize usability, positioning PonchoNotes as a leading player in the augmented reality note-taking space.
